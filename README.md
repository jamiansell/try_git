This is a repo for learning git and testing out potential new ways of doing things. 

## Tip #1 - How to use static images in github

Rather than hosting images externally, use issue comments to add images if they are necessary for completing the task within the issue. For example, if the task is to update the README and in order to do that most effectively, it should include images, add the images to the comments for that issue so that you can link to them from the readme (or anywhere else they should be used in the repo like, for example, wiki pages)

Issue #1 was created because I needed to improve this readme with images. The image below was dragged and dropped into a comment on issue #1. Then I was able to take the converted md string and add it to the this readme md file. Confirming that it worked allowed me to then close the issue.
